This is one of the most baffling illusions I’ve ever seen. Take a look at the
gif below.  First, look at any yellow dot as the figure moves. The yellow dot
remains present and stationary. If you concentrate on all three yellow dots,
they remain there as well.

But now concentrate on the central green dot. You will see one or more of the
yellow dots disappearing and then reappearing sporadically. They are not—this is
an optical illusion. The dots remain and your brain simply doesn’t register
their presence from time to time. Weird, eh?
