## World Value Survey

At the [Rostock Retreat 2017](http://www.rostock-retreat.org/2017/), our team was assigned to analyze data from the 6th wave of the World Value Survey,
http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV6.jsp.  The vague instructions were:


> Run analyses on this dataset related to a one or a few research questions which you are free to choose. Ideally you should conduct both descriptive analyses as well as specify models. The outcomes shall be presented in visualized form.


## Preliminaries

Ugh! The dataset was provided as an `.rdata` file that had been exported from some other software (SPSS?). The variables were named `V1` ... `V263`, and there was a separate Codebook, in Excel format, giving the survey questions and the coding of responses.  

There was a lot (too much!) of work just to make this comprehensible and remove observations with a variety of missing value codes.

The original data set had 90,350 observations and 430 variables. We pick up here with a subset data set of 81,284 observations and 12 variables.

```{r}
folder <- file.path(myutil::dropbox_folder(), "Documents", "6135", "R", "WVS")
setwd(folder)
load(file.path(folder, "WVS6.RData"))
names(WVS)
```

Load the main packages we'll be using:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(magrittr)
library(corrplot)
```

### Recoding

Some of our variables of interest were coded on 1-4 or 1-5 scales, where `1` means highest.  For interpretability, we reverse these
scales so that a larger number means more. 

```{r}
WVS <- WVS %>%
		mutate(Happiness =    5-Happiness,
		       Health =       5-Health,
		       Social_class = 6-Social_class)	
WVS <- WVS %>% as_tibble()

WVS                             

```

## Country means

The data is hierarchical, in that respondents to the survey are nested within `Country`.
One simple form of analyis uses just the country means 
```{r}
WVS_mean <- WVS %>% group_by(Country_Code) %>% 
  summarise(Country  =max(Country),
            Happiness=mean(Happiness),
            Health   =mean(Health),
            Age      =mean(Age),
            Life_sat =mean(Life_sat),
            Income   =mean(Income),
            Kids     =mean(Kids),
            Social_class =mean(Social_class),
            Education=mean(Education)
            )

```
It is usful to classify countries by continent.  The `countrycode` package has a function that converts a variety of
country code forms among one another.  Without this, we would have to use a massive `recode()` statement to do these
individually by country name or country code. Using `dplyr`, this is just a `mutate()` call.

```{r countrycode}
library(countrycode)
WVS_mean <- WVS_mean %>%
	 mutate(Continent = countrycode(Country, "country.name", "continent"))
```

As a first step, we can examine the distributions of mean `Happiness` by continent.

```{r mean-boxplot1}
ggplot(WVS_mean, aes(x=Continent, y=Happiness)) +
	geom_boxplot(aes(fill=Continent))

```
