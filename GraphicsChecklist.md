## A Checklist For Good Graphical Practice

From: [Gordon & Finch (2015) "Statistician Heal Thyself: Have We Lost the Plot?", *JCGS*, 1210-1229, ](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2014.989324)

These questions and suggestions are a useful set to apply to graphs designed for presentation purposes.
I don't agree with all of them, but they are a very good start for things to think about in
graphical practice.  

### How clear is your purpose in communication?

* What relationships or patterns can you identify in the graph?
* Are these the relationships or patterns you intended to represent?
* Can the viewer identify the patterns you wish to illustrate?
* Are the important comparisons you wish to show salient?

## Make clarity a high priority.

* Does the graph have a clear title?
* Are the axes labeled?
* Are the units of the variables measured defined?
* Are the units of observation clear?
* Is the graph large enough?
* Would ordering groups or variables plotted improve the graph?
* Are all the graph labels horizontal?
* Use points to plot estimates (e.g., means, proportions) rather than bars.

## Choose standard forms fit for your purpose.

* Use bars around points to indicate the precision of the estimates.
* Plot the estimates of interest (e.g., mean differences with confidence intervals) rather than standard summary statistics (group means).
* Plot inferences to support stories about models.
* Plot data to support stories about distributions and variation.

## Consider detection issues.

* Can all the data points be seen?
* Are patterns in the data clear?
* Are the fonts large enough?
* Would it help to use jittering, or another form of representing multiple, identical values?

## Would panels help?

* Are there grouping variables that can be used to panel the graph?
* Do the grouping variables correspond to the variation of interest?
* Would additional panels help?

## Align quantities to be compared on a common scale.

* Has distortion of the data been avoided by using the same scales for the same measurement?
* Are measurements made on the same scale plotted on the same scale?
* Would transposition improve the graph?

## Does the graph have grid lines?

* Light gray grid lines will help with accurate interpretation.

## Are all the elements of the graph defined?

* What do points on the graph correspond to?
* Are estimates (e.g., means, proportions) plotted on the graph clearly defined?
* Are bars around points on the graph clearly defined?

## How much decoding work does the viewer have to do?

* Is it easy for someone unfamiliar with your data to interpret your graph?
* Does the graph stand alone?
* Try it on a friend!
