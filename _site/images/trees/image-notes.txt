Geschictesbaum Europa

A novel design is used in the Geschichtsbaum Europa (author unknown) to show a
thematic view of the entire history of Europe in a tree structure. With the base
of the trunk at 0 A.D., branches for different countries Germany, France, Spain,
... and domains of thought ( politics, church, culture) grow upward and outward.
Dated events appear as the leaves of the tree. Events B.C. are shown under the
roots of the tree.

Treemaps display hierarchical (tree-structured) data as a set of nested rectangles. Each branch of the tree is given a rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller rectangles representing sub-branches. A leaf node's rectangle has an area proportional to a specified dimension of the data. Often the leaf nodes are colored to show a separate dimension of the data.

When the color and size dimensions are correlated in some way with the tree structure, one can often easily see patterns that would be difficult to spot in other ways, such as if a certain color is particularly relevant. A second advantage of treemaps is that, by construction, they make efficient use of space. As a result, they can legibly display thousands of items on the screen simultaneously.
